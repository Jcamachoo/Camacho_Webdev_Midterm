<strong><em><br>Whose coffee is that? I think I know.</strong></em>
<br> Its owner is quite happy though.
<br> Happiness displayed in his face like a rainbow,
<br> I watch him laugh. I cry hello.
<br>
<strong><em><br> He gives his coffee a shake,</strong></em>
<br> And laughs until his belly aches.
<br> The only other sound's the break,
<br> Of distant waves and birds awake.
<br>
<strong><em><br> The coffee is hot, sweet and deep,</strong></em>
<br> But he has promises to keep,
<br> After cake and lots of sleep.
<br> Sweet dreams come to him cheap.
<br>
<br> He rises from his soft and gentle bed,
<br> With thoughts of kittens in his head,
<br> He eats his jam with lots of bread.
<strong><em><br> Ready for the day ahead.</strong></em>
