Whose coffee is that? I think I know.
Its owner is quite happy though.
Happiness displayed in his face like a rainbow,
I watch him laugh. I cry hello.

He gives his coffee a shake,
And laughs until her belly aches.
The only other sound's the break,
Of distant waves and birds awake.

The coffee is hot, sweet and deep,
But he has promises to keep,
After cake and lots of sleep.
Sweet dreams come to him cheap.

He rises from his soft and gentle bed,
With thoughts of kittens in his head,
He eats his jam with lots of bread.
Ready for the day ahead.
